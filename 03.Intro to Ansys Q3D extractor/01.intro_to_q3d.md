Transcript:
(00:00) And welcome to this series of courses on 'how to get started with Ansys Q3D'. And in our other previous videos we've shown the user interface of the student version of the Ansys electronics desktop and that's AEDT for short. So, Ansys offers several electromagnetic solvers within the single AEDT user interface.
(00:32) We've HFSS, we've Maxwell, we've SIwave which are finite element (FEM) based solvers and SBR+, which is based on ray tracing and now Q3D is a quasi static solver and all these solvers solve Maxwell's equations but in different approaches. In this video we're going to introduce you to the Q3D design type in the Ansys electronics desktop and Q3D as I said is the 3D quasi-static electromagnetic EM simulation software tool and it calculates fields, equivalent circuits, S-parameters, Inductances, resistance and capacitance
(01:11) and the Q3D tool has similar results that the other solvers also have. Results that electrical engineers look for and the key differentiator in this tool is in the term quasi statics. So what this quasi static mean? It means that this frequency tends to zero. Just making the wave effect negligible and it decouples the E and H in Maxwell's equations and depending on the application you're trying to simulate you can solve for just one field you can solve for E or H and this save your computational resources.
(01:48) What does that mean? It's savings in both time and hardware resources, memory resources In short Q3D is a simulation software tool streamlined for quickly determining electro-parasitic values of inductance, capacitance, resistance and conductance. Q3D can be used for extracting the lumped RLCG parameters and spice models as well and it can also be used for low frequency power, signal integrity and select high frequency applications.
(02:21) Wide varied applications and the process flow for Q3D is really simple. It's very easy to follow. and what are they? Create the 3D structure, add boundary conditions, add nets, assign terminals, setup the solve solutions, view them. So, lets go ahead and expand on these steps a bit more. Like most of the Ansys simulation tools the first and foremost step is to draw the physical model geometry simulate what you are going to model and you can create 3D objects or 2D surface models inside of Q3D.
(02:54) You can import the structures that are designed using other CAD tool as well or you can actively link your model drawing, your mechanical drawing as drawn inside the Ansys Spaceclaim. It's in the toolbar. Next, now let's assign boundary conditions and Q3D offers two types of boundary conditions thin conductor or infinite ground plane.
(03:16) The thin conductor boundary replaces the 3D conductor with the 2D sheets. So what does this mean? It means that the current lines on the conductor lies on a 2D surface. For example if you use a conductor trace and you use the rectangular 3D model instead of determining where the current lies whether on the top or the bottom or the sides it's now on a 2D surface equivalent 2D surface for that 3D object.
(03:43) So it helps you to specify location of the charges and the 2D sheet it can be any lined or curved surface It doesn't have to be rectilinear any shape without limitation. The infinite ground plane you can apply that to a surface or an object and it has what does the name applies assigns that object or surface to an infinite extents.
(04:03) So what does that translate to that means simplifying the analytical equations your solving limits are now infinity. Also note you can only have one infinite ground boundary condition in a single design. Ok, so next step, assign nets. What's a net? So a net is the collection of touching conductor materials or surfaces or objects.
(04:24) Note you can't have perfect electrical conductors in the same net as some non PEC conductor material. So you can assign nets manually or automatically to any conductor ends and that's can be classified as signal floating or ground nets and a terminal can be assigned to a 2D or 3D object and it could be assigned as a source or a sink.
(04:45) Signal nets are typically sources and floating or ground nets are sinks. You must use your engineering knowledge to define these terminals because the assignment define the way Q3D solves. Q3D offers three types of solution setups They are the capacitance the conductance, DC resistance and inductance, AC resistance and inductance plus nice thing about it you can generate these resulting RLCG field plots in any corresponding E or H field plot any corresponding electric or magnetic field plot you get a visualization of these fields.
(05:23) So by default Q3D extractor is AC RL and DC RL solver. They're constant voltage, equipotential terminals. For the AC RL calculations a constant voltage is held over the perimeter of the terminal face of that selected surface and for the DC RL calculations the constant voltage is held over the area of the terminal face.
(05:48) Now if you have a long list of nets perhaps many conductor terminals that don't touch but they are electrically connected. Q3D supports the matrix reduction so you can manually assign them and in the solve setup you explicitly select a Q3D solution that you're interested in the capacitance and conductance the DC resistance and inductance DC RL the AC resistance and inductance AC RL.
(06:16) You can select any of these or all of these and after the simulation model is solved you can perform post processing of the obtained results. You can view the solution data in rectangular tabular format or in a rectangular plot. If you setup the variables and you perform the parametric solve you can then view the optimetric results.
(06:36) You can plot the field plots the E and H, overlaid them on the model geometry. You can create animations of these field quantities as well. Over and above that you can create custom quantities and then also plot them. There's lots of things that you can do inside of Q3D. Actually lots of things and customization you can do in any of our Ansys tools.
(06:56) So we just went over the steps that are necessary to launch a Q3D extractor simulation. In the next video we're going to show you how to design and analyze a planar spiral inductor using Q3D and so thank you for watching this getting started video on the Ansys Q3D extractor tool and for more information on our Ansys electronic tools or any of our Ansys simulation tools please go to ansys.com/course today.
