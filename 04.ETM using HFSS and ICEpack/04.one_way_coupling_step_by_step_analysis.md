Transcript:
(00:00) And welcome back! and in the previous video module, we discussed the one-way electrothermal management coupling between HFSS and Icepak using the EMtoIcepak ACT Extension and in this video, we'll see how to set up that same Icepak simulation model manually step by step inside of AEDT Student version. Here's the AEDT Student version interface showing that same waveguide model.
(00:40) Let's go ahead add a thermal Icepak simulation. Click on the desktop tab and on the top row select insert > an Icepak design into the current project. View that there's an inserted Icepak model geometry window and inside there you'll see a red outline rectangular box appear and this represents the Icepak air region similarly to the HFSS auto open air region and in the HFSS model geometry window go ahead select all of the visible objects by using ctrl+A and then use ctrl+C to make a copy.
(01:19) Go to the Icepak model geometry window with that red outline box and use ctrl+V and that paste all that copied model geometry from the HFSS design into that Icepak model design. Use ctrl+D to fit all the content so that you can view it. Notice the air region also automatically changed to include all that pasted objects.
(01:44) All the geometries are copied including the material properties that were entered in that HFSS model. A few simple clicks and you imported the model geometry and the material assignments from HFSS electromagnetics an EM solver to Icepak a fluid solver without using file import all those operations and steps and then reassigning materials into that model geometry.
(02:10) Quick and simple! Of course you can edit the default air padding as required a small air region can restrict the simulated airflow. You may see that the results don't match your measured results. Go ahead let's edit the padding to match the model that was created using the EMtoIcepak wizard. In the project manager window, select the Icepak design.
(02:34) Right mouse click and select solution type. Confirm the solution type is steady state. Go ahead confirm that the problem type is set to temperature and flow. Now let's assign the thermal boundary conditions. Switch to face selection mode by pressing the F key on the keyboard. Select the face of the air region along the negative X axis.
(02:59) Right mouse click in the 3D modeler window. Select assign thermal > opening > free. Enter input as name and under flow specs select velocity for the inlet type. Select one for velocity and keep the units as meters per second. Click OK and select the force along the positive X axis. Right mouse click and select assign thermal > opening and free.
(03:25) Enter outlet as the name. Keep the default settings click OK. Now let's designate the objects and surfaces keep in or generate the heat or dissipate it and let's it go. In the history tree select all the objects except that air region. Right mouse click on the 3D modeler window and select assign thermal and then select EM loss.
(03:50) One window pops up and in the general tab in that setup link in that dialog box select use this project checkbox and under the source design select that HFSS design and under the source solution select the solution setup from that HFSS design. Check both simulate source design as needed and preserve source design solution.
(04:12) In that variable mapping tab, if you are doing a parametric study click the appropriate map variable by name to include the source design variable as well inside that Icepak design or just leave it as is. In the intrinsic tab which defines HFSS intrinsic variables make sure that the solution frequency inside of HFSS is selected.
(04:35) Click OK. A new window pops up with the name EM loss and here you'll see waveguide_outer is placed under surface loss and the waveguide_inner is placed in the volume losses. Go ahead let's view the design settings. Right mouse click on that Icepak design and select design settings. Retain the default settings on the ambient conditions the gravity and validation tab click OK.
(05:04) Right mouse click on the analysis. Select add solution setup to add an Icepak solution setup. In the Icepak solve setup dialog box, maximum number of iterations to 200, the problem type temperature and flow and make sure both are checked, the flow regime type is turbulent. The radiation model is discrete ordinates and check include gravity.
(05:30) In the convergence tab edit the flow and the energy criteria as shown. Go to the solver settings tab and input 1 meters per second for the X velocity as given while defining the inlet boundary and in the radiation tab we're retaining again all the defaults here. Click OK save the settings. Now this confirms that the step-by-step solve setup matches the EMtoIcepak wizard setup.
(05:58) Now let's generate that mesh in Icepak. In the project manager window right mouse click on mesh and select edit global region and we'll keep it somewhere between medium and fine click OK select the mesh category again right mouse click select generate and once that mesh is generated view the mesh. As stated before the HFSS and Icepak have different mesh types.
(06:24) Yes, you can also select the required object from the tree window and click on geometry boundary selection to view that specific mesh. To start the Icepak analysis, right mouse click on setup1 go ahead select analyze and during or at the end of the analysis right mouse click on setup1 and select residual. Now you can look at the convergence as it's analyzing after the solution is converged go to the profile tab to view the solution profile.
(06:56) Browse through the profile and find mapped EM losses and go ahead crosscheck that these values are the same as that calculating the field calculator values that were determined in the HFSS model. Now let's add the temperature plot select both the waveguide_outer and waveguide_inner. Right mouse click select plot fields then temperature and again select temperature.
(07:21) In the create field plot dialog box. keep the default selection for under the quantity and in the volume. Go ahead select the plot on surface only checkbox click Done and you'll see that the thermal profile of the waveguide model. In this model we had 5 watts of power into the waveguide and this yielded some temperature increase from the 20 degrees C ambient as shown below.
(07:47) Since, we used the EMtoIcepak model the temperature profile should be the same and the solve setup was the same so the plot should be same. The temperature is higher near the twist as compared to the straight run and we can repeat what we did in the previous module. Go to the tree model history tree expand the planes category select the XY plane of the relative coordinate system1.
(08:14) Right mouse click on the 3D modeler window. Select plot fields, select velocity, select velocity vectors. Keep all the defaults in the dialog box click Done to display the velocity field plot. Now to verify that the energy balance using the field summary report. Go ahead click on the results tab click on the field summary in the options window make sure to check under entity boundaries checked and under geometry type surfaces check.
(08:45) Select the adjacent side checkbox select both inlet and outlet in the entity and under the quantity select heat flow rate, click that the add drop down button and select add as a single calculation. That's the total heat that's transferred from the twisted waveguide. Note again that it matches the surface losses that were computed in the HFSS field calculator and the surface losses applied in the profile monitor.
(09:16) Results for the one-way coupled ETM workflow from HFSS to Icepak is the same when using the EmtoIcepak wizard or using this step-by-step method. As you can see the temperature profile of this waveguide in Icepak increased well in the volume and surface profile results from HFSS. So far we have discussed dielectric filled waveguide twist simulation model and the resulting thermal profile the temperature profile for a hollow waveguide will be similar to this one as shown here.
(09:51) Here the twist portion is hotter than the straight portion and as discussed earlier in the previous videos the currents are more concentrated in the twist cavity and hence the temperature is higher. Here is some waveguide design with the partially filled area such as one shown here. It's thermal profile is shown here and from these models you can see __ that the dielectric losses and the conductor losses are the main sources for the temperature increase in the model.
(10:25) In the next video we'll show you how to set up a two-way coupling using the same model and see how the Icepak results affect the HFSS simulation.
