Transcript:
(00:00) Welcome back! and in the previous video we presented some key aspects of why electro thermal management is important and in this video we will show you how easy it is to perform an electro thermal management analysis using HFSS and Icepak using the EMtoIcepak wizard. So let's get started. Here is the AEDT interface and it's showing the twisted WR-15 waveguide cavity.
(00:41) It's filled with FR4 epoxy as the dielectric material and this waveguide is designed for using the 5G millimeter wave application. In the intro to Ansys HFSS Getting Started course we use the HFSS default outer boundary condition of PEC perfect electrical conductor and this was sufficient for determining the modes that are propagating inside the waveguide cavity and for determining their cutoff frequencies electrical characteristics but in order to perform an electro thermal management workflow we need to use real materials with real losses in order to calculate
(01:21) the waveguide losses that are due to its material properties and in our Ansys ETM workflow we use HFSS to accurately determine where the current flow is and this provides information to Icepak our fluid solver to characterize the heat losses to this electronic device and the current flow in a waveguide is on the metal walls as there's no other outer conductor therefore we need to now model the outside metal housing of the waveguide something that is a less than perfect conductor aluminum is a good choice and here's the updated geometry
(02:01) model with an aluminum metal housing. Now it covers the FR4 dielectric waveguide cavity the inside and the input and the output ports are defined as shown below the analysis setup is defined as follows again same as in the previous model setup. Here's the frequency sweep Now after analyzing this model let's view the EM simulation results.
(02:26) Here's the S-parameter plot, the phase constant plot and the electric field animation for the first mode which is overlaid on the model geometry. Nice visualization and the resulting curves for the HFSS simulation with the default PEC boundary condition and now with the aluminum housing the results are comparable they're almost on top of each other.
(02:50) So let's look at some of the details of this model. In the project manager window right mouse click on excitations and select edit sources. In that pop-up window you see that the excitation was set to 5 watts. Close the window and the field calculator is used to evaluate the surface and volume loss of the simulation model.
(03:10) Click on the HFSS menu on the top ribbon, select fields and then calculator to open the field calculator interface. This pops up in a new window and remember what you can also open the field calculator from the project manager window always more than one ways to do something in AEDT. Right mouse click on the field overlays and select calculator.
(03:34) Under input click quantity and select surface loss density. Now click on the geometry and select surface. Select the waveguide_outer which represents the waveguide metal walls. Click OK and under scalar click integrate, under output click evaluate eval and then we have the surface losses is calculated in watts and similarly let's go and calculate the volume loss density.
(04:02) Select waveguide_inner and this represents the waveguide cavity volume both the surface loss and the volume loss these are the EM losses of the model determined by HFSS and we're going to use them to compare or verify the Icepak results those that are calculated with the fluid solver the surface loss on the metal walls is due to the finite conductivity of the conductors of the metal and the volume loss in the dielectric cavity which is due to the dielectric losses or retention of the material.
(04:38) Our HFSS simulation is now set so let's go move on to the Icepak simulation and the simplest way of doing this is to use the EMtoIcepak ACT extension and this automatically creates the Icepak model from the HFSS electromagnetic simulation model with the EMtoIcepak ACT extension installed simply click on the view tab select ACT extension the ACT home page appears select launch wizard select EMtoIcepak wizard and when the EMtoIcepak dialog box pops up just be sure that the appropriate HFSS waveguide project and its design and
(05:20) setup show up in the project text box. You can always have more than one design. Make sure the correct one is selected. Select no to the two way coupling and keep everything else as default. Go ahead select launch and you'll see the progress bar move you'll see windows automatically appear and the analysis has been launched and once the analysis has completed you'll see that both temperature profile and a velocity plot appears.
(05:48) See below it's simple and easy! An electro thermal analysis workflow using the EMtoIcepak wizard in our next video we'll show you how to download and install the ACT extension it's EMtoIcepak ACT extension and then show you a manual step-by-step setup of this workflow what went on behind the scenes. Thank you for watching this video on the model preparation for the electro thermal management workflow using the EMtoIcepak wizard.
