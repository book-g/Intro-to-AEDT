# **Step-by-Step Guide: Two-Way Coupling Between Ansys Maxwell and Icepak (Part 1)**

This guide explains how to set up **electrothermal management (ETM) simulation** by coupling **Ansys Maxwell (Eddy Current Solver) with Ansys Icepak** to analyze heat dissipation in an **electromagnetic brake (EMB)**.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding Electrothermal Management (ETM)**
- **Ohmic losses from eddy currents** generate **heat**, affecting material properties.
- **Each material has a safe operating temperature limit**:
  - If exceeded, materials degrade, causing **malfunctions, damage, or safety risks**.
- **Coupling Maxwell (Electromagnetics) with Icepak (Thermal Analysis)** allows engineers to:
  - Identify **heat sources** from power losses.
  - Analyze **heat flow and dissipation** in the system.
  - Improve **thermal performance and safety**.

## **Step 2: Open and Prepare the Project**
1. **Open Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT)**.
2. Load the **EMB project file** from the **previous Eddy Current Simulation**.
3. Create a **new project** and rename it to:
   ```
   EMB_EddyCurrent_Icepak
   ```
4. **Drag and drop** the **eddy current design** from the **EMB project** into the **new project**.
5. **Close** the **old EMB project**.

## **Step 3: Define Material Thermal Properties**
1. In the **Model Tree**, **right-click on Copper** → **Select Properties**.
2. Click **View/Edit Material**.
3. In the **pop-up window**, go to the **Thermal Modifier** tab.
4. A new column named **Thermal Modifier** appears for **Bulk Conductivity**.
5. Click **Edit** under **Thermal Modifier**.
6. In the **pop-up window**, define material properties:
   - **Use a temperature-dependent dataset**:
     - Check the **Radio Button** for **temperature dependence**.
     - **Import a dataset** or **manually enter data** via **Edit Dataset**.
   - **Alternatively, use a quadratic equation**:
     - Select the **Quadratic option**.
7. **Use the standard expression for copper**:
   ```
   ρ(T) = ρ₀ (1 + α(T - T₀))
   ```
   - **Copper resistivity temperature coefficient (α) = 0.0039 /°C**.

## **Step 4: Enable Temperature Feedback**
1. **Right-click** on the **Design Name** → Select **Set Object Temperature**.
2. In the **Temperature of Objects Panel**:
   - **Enable "Include Temperature Dependence"**.
   - **Enable "Feedback"**.
3. Click **OK**.

---

## **Step 5: Validate and Run the Simulation**
1. **Click on the Simulation Tab**.
2. **Validate the Design** to check for errors.
3. **Right-click on Analysis** → Select **Analyze All**.
4. **Once analysis is complete**, verify **Ohmic Loss Values**:
   - **Right-click on Results** → **Create Field Report** → **Data Table**.
   - Under **Category**, select **Calculator Expressions**.
   - Select all three loss functions:
     - **Loss_Plate**
     - **Loss_Core**
     - **Loss_Coil**
   - **Press Ctrl and Click "New Report"**.
5. View the **Ohmic Losses in a Table**.

---

## **Step 6: Prepare for Maxwell-Icepak Thermal Coupling**
- The **Maxwell design is now ready** to be coupled with **Icepak** for **thermal analysis**.
- **In the next step**, we will:
  - Import Maxwell losses into Icepak.
  - Set up the thermal boundary conditions.
  - Run the thermal simulation.

This completes **Part 1** of the **Ansys Maxwell and Icepak Two-Way Coupling Simulation**. ✅

Transcript:
(00:00) And welcome back! and in the last video we performed an eddy current simulation to find the ohmic losses in various parts of an EMB, an electromagnetic brake and these losses dissipate as heat and heat is the main enemy of an EM device. In real physical devices each material used as a safe operating temperature limit and if they are not operated within these thermal limit they will degrade over time, perhaps malfunction, cause damage and even pose safety concerns and in this two part video we'll look at how an engineer can
(00:54) invetigate the thermal heat transfer problem and make informed decisions by performing an ETM an electrothermal management workflow simulation using Ansys Maxwell and Icepak within the AEDT Student version. Now Ansys Maxwell is our electromagnetic simulation tool It allows us to identify the amount of power loss in the various part of a device or system and this is the source of heat.
(01:29) These electrical loss profiles when coupled into Ansys Icepak enables us to identify and visualize the heat flow in the various parts of the system and will discuss more about it while setting up the simulation So, let's get started. Open the EMB project file from our previous video in AEDT Create a new project and rename it to EMB_Eddycurrent_Icepak.
(02:04) Drag and drop the eddy current design from the EMB project to the new project that was just created. Now close the EMB project, expand the model tree right mouse click on the copper and select properties. Click on View/Edit material and in the popup window select thermal modifier. A new column named thermal modifier appears for the bulk conductivity select edit under the thermal modifier from the drop down menu and in that popup window either enter an expression for the modifier or use a temperature dependent dataset
(02:47) by checking the radiobox and you can either import the dataset or add the data manually by selecting edit dataset. You can also define the thermal modifier using a quadratic equation by selecting the quadratic option. So, let's use the standard expression for copper as shown here and since copper resistivity conductivity varies with temperature we are using the temperature coefficient of resistivity for copper which is 0.
(03:27) 0039 per degree Celsius and note that the details how these values were measured for the various components in your design helps increase the accuracy of your Icepak simulation heat profile and also the temperature dependent properties must be define for at least one component to use two way coupling between Maxwell and Icepak Click OK to close the windows Right mouse click on the design name and select set object temperature In the temperature of objects panel enable the include temperature dependence and enable feedback.
(04:08) Click OK and click on simulation tab and validate the design to make sure there are no errors in the setup Right mouse click on the analysis and select analyze all and from the previous video we have the named expressions for the losses using the field calculator and once the analysis is complete we can view these values again Right mouse click on results create field report data table and under category select calculator expressions Select all three functions under the quantity by holding the ctrl key and clicking on new report
(04:55) and you'll see the ohmic losses for the three components in a tabular format and now this Maxwell design is ready to be coupled with Icepak for the thermal heat transfer analysis In the next video we'll see how to setup and perform Maxwell Icepak coupling simulation.
