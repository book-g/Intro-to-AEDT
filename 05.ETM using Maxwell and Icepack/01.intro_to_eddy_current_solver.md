(00:00) Welcome back! and in this course we're going to present the Ansys Maxwell eddy current solver with Icepak for performing an electrothermal management analysis ETM for short. So Ansys Maxwell is used to simulate your model design for an electronic electromagnetic analysis. and then that electronic results are going to be coupled into the fluid base solver Icepak for thermal analysis.
(00:38) and in this video we're going to analyze that electromagnetic brake using the eddy current solver in Ansys Mawell that same model geometry that we had used to discuss that magnetostatic solver in Ansys Maxwell. So, what's the difference between the magnetostatic solver and the eddy current solver inside the Maxwell Well, the magnetostatic solver that assumes a steady state DC current and permanent magnets as their excitations.
(01:17) and from an application perspective the steady DC current in the windings create a steady field and static flux linkage for each of those windings Whereas the eddy current solver is an AC magnetic solver and that's a quasi static solver Now that assumes only the steady AC currents as an excitation. and from the application perspective the AC current in the windings create the steady state AC magnetic fields and these AC fields induce other currents in the solid conductors as well as in neighboring a coils.
(02:05) So, this frequency domain solution It assumes that the frequency is the same throughout the domain. So, let's go ahead and open that same EMB project file that we created in the last course in the magnetostatic simulation on a EMB Electromagnetic brake and in this project file we have a design that's named EMB_3D1 and that we copied from origin design file to create a 2D design Right mouse click on that design select solution type and change the solution type to eddy current.
(02:44) Select the design name and you'll see the design variables under the property windows. Go ahead change that Amp value to 5 amps The eddy current solver considers the current value as the peak The peak value of the AC current at the frequency that we defined under the analysis setup Right mouse click on excitations select set eddy effects and once the popup window appears select eddy effect only for the core and for the brake plate and we can delete the parametric setup as we are not going to do any parametric simulations in this video.
(03:29) Though we can run the parametric setup with any of the design variables. Go ahead right mouse click on the analysis setup and select the solution setup under that general tab change the percentage error to 2 under the solver tab change the adaptive frequency to 300 Hz Press OK. Go to the simulation tab select validate To make sure that there are no errors in the simulation setup.
(04:00) Go to analysis right mouse click on setup1 select analyze and after the simulation is complete we can now calculate the local ohmic loss in the various parts of the design We're going to use the field calculator Right mouse click on the field overlays and select calculator from the fields calculator panel and again under input > geometry volume, Brake_Plate Under scalar select integrate.
(04:35) Click add and enter the name as loss_plate and similarly let's create the ohmic loss the named expressions for the core and the coil and name them as loss_core and loss_coil. Go ahead select loss_core from the named expression list Select copy to stack Select eval under the output option and this ohmic loss in the core volume is displayed in watts and these losses are the induced AC losses in the core and similarly you can also check these ohmic loss for the brake plate and the coil Select brake plate right mouse click on the field overlays
(05:24) Fields > J > Vector_J and now you can see the current distribution on the bottom of the brake plate. Select brake plate right click on the field overlays Fields > Other > Ohmic_Loss Go ahead change the orientation under draw tab to bottom Z just to better visualize the plot and this shows the ohmic loss distribution on that bottom of the brake plate and it is in agreement with the current density vector plot.
(05:56) Let's look at the force acting on the brake plate Go to results, right mouse click Create EddyCurrent Report > Data table. In the popup window under category select Force and under quantity select ACForce magnitude and you can see that the force is 2.8 kilo Newtons which is higher and may be possible but at the expense of other practical limitations.
(06:25) and one of the limitations is the magnetic saturation of the material. Let's look at mag_B field plot and you can see that the maximum flux density values are around 2.4 Tesla which indicates that the flux density levels is beyond the magnetic saturation limits of the core and the brake plate material and this results in a higher core losses.
(06:52) Another limitation to be checked before concluding any EM design is the thermal operation So, this completes the eddy current simulation in Maxwell on that EMB. Next we're going to show you how to perform that thermal cosimulation with Icepak.
