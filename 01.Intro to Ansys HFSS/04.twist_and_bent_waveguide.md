(00:07) and welcome! and welcome to this video introducing HFSS in the student version of the Ansys Electronics Desktop or AEDT for short and in our videos, we have presented a simple air filled rectangular waveguide, a dielectrically stacked rectangular waveguide and in this video we will add a little twist to that rectangular waveguide and a bent rectangular waveguide and waveguides in themselves they are used to guide the fields inside and the twist and the bend should be implemented gradually otherwise the fields can be distorted
(00:47) and therefore you actually distorting your intended signal and twists are primarily used to change the polarity of the signal whereas bends can be used to how to fit the physical waveguide to a smaller physical space. So, let's get started! So, here is the interface of the tool with the HFSS design for the WR15 waveguide and this is the waveguide cavity already created using variables as dimensions and I will use this model again for creating the bend and the twist.
(01:20) I rename the project and check that the unit type is also in millimeters. So, let's go ahead and design and analyze this twisted geometry. If you haven't copy and paste design and rename it. Delete the output port of the waveguide cavity and switch to the face selection mode by pressing the F key on the keyboard.
(01:45) Remember there is always more than one way of doing things in AEDT. You could also with draw panel open you can also switch the face selection by using the dropdown menu on the select panel. Select the face along the poisitive X axis. Right mouse click select edit -> surface -> create object from face and notice you have a 2D object is created under the sheets category.
(02:12) Edit the name of that object call it something. Now, select and draw a line draw line command. Place the first coordinate on the face center of that sheet and then the other coordinate anywhere else in the 3D modeler window and notice that one polyline is created under the lines category. Double mouse click on that create line command.
(02:35) Edit coordinates of that line segment. Enter the values as shown and its good practice to use variables wherever possible for a more robust design. After editing click OK to accept the changes. and with the sheet and the polyline selected right mouse click in the 3D modeler window. Select edit then sweep along a path.
(02:58) a new window pops up and in the cell next to the angle of the twist enter -90 and keep the rest as defaults click OK and notice the twisted geometry is created in the 3D modeler window and observe the rotation of the face of the waveguide cavity. Also, notice that the sheet object is modified to a solid type in a model tree window and select the face along the positive X axis.
(03:28) Right mouse click select edit -> surface -> sweep face along the normal and in the pop up window enter the dimensions as shown. Click OK to accept. Rename the newly created object. Unite all the objects to create a single object and proceed to create the wave port excitation on the face along the X axis. and this concludes the geometry creation required for the waveguide twist analysis.
(03:58) Creation of the ports and the analysis is the same as the rectangular waveguide. So, go through our previous simulation setup for the straight run waveguide and apply to this model and check the validation tool before proceeding just in case we have some errors and once the analysis is done we can view the results.
(04:19) Here is the phase constant plot for port input with the markers denoting the cutoff frequency and for the different modes Here is the phase constant plot for the port output and the markers again denoting the cutoff frequencies of the different modes and here is the plot of the electric field inside the whole geometry.
(04:46) Here is the animation of this plot. Waveguide bends are also of two types E-bends and H-bends. Okay let's proceed with the H-bend geometry creation. Copy and paste this HFSS design. The WR-15 and rename it. I rename this project as waveguide_bend and delete the input port of the waveguide cavity and we will use a relative local coordinate system to create the bend geometry and the sweep option.
(05:22) So, lets proceed to the geometry creation and select the face along the negative X axis. Right mouse click select edit then surface and then create object from face and with the draw tab open select the offset origin option and click anywhere along the Y axis in the 3D modeler window. Navigate to the relative coordinate system in the model tree.
(05:48) Double click on it to edit and change the name of this coordinate system and change the origin position as shown. Let's go ahead and use a variable for the radius of the bend. Input a dimension in the window and click OK to proceed. Edit that name of that 2D object in the model tree window and with the 2D object selected right mouse click on the modeler window.
(06:13) Select edit -> sweep -> around an axis and for the sweep axis option select Z axis for the angle of sweep input -90 degrees and keep the rest as default and now you can see the bend for the waveguide is created in the 3D modeler window and notice that the relative coordinate system is selected as the reference and select the face of that bent geometry along the Y axis and right mouse click select edit -> surface and sweep faces along a normal In that pop up window enter the dimension as shown and click OK to accept
(06:52) and rename the newly created object. Now unite all the objects to create a single geometry and proceed to create the wave port excitation on the face along the positive Y axis. Now we are all set to proceed with the analysis and check the validation tool before proceeding just in case we have some errors and once the analysis is done we can view the results.
(07:19) So, here is the phase constant plot for the port input with the markers denoting the cut off frequencies of the different modes and here is the phase constant plot for the port output with the markers again denoting the cut off frequencies of the different modes. So, here is the plot of the electric field inside the whole geometry and here is the animation of this plot and this is the beauty of the electromagnetic simulation.
(07:50) You can visualize how the fields are guided through any complex geometries very easily. Thank you for watching this video.
