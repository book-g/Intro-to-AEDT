Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the **actions, events, and functions** described in the transcript for setting up and analyzing a **rectangular waveguide simulation** using Ansys HFSS:

---

### **Step 1: Assign Wave Port Excitation**
- **Action**: Select the face along the X-axis minimum, right-click, and assign excitation > Port > Wave Port.
- **Event**: Rename the port as "input" and set the number of modes to 5.
- **Function**: Define the input port for signal excitation in the waveguide.

---

### **Step 2: Assign Output Wave Port**
- **Action**: Repeat the process for the face on the X-axis maximum, naming it "output."
- **Event**: Set the number of modes to 5.
- **Function**: Define the output port for signal transmission.

---

### **Step 3: Add Solution Setup**
- **Action**: Right-click on Analysis in the Project Manager window and select "Add Solution Setup > Advanced."
- **Event**: Set the solution frequency to 30 GHz (for 5G millimeter-wave band).
- **Function**: Define the frequency at which HFSS will create the mesh and perform the simulation.

---

### **Step 4: Configure Solution Options**
- **Action**: Go to the Options tab and ensure "Lambda refinement" is checked.

### **Step 9: Plot Propagation Constant (Gamma)**
- **Action**: Right-click on Results > Create Modal Solution > Rectangular Plot.
- **Event**: Select "Gamma" under Category, choose all modes for Port 1, and select "Im" (imaginary part).
- **Function**: Plot the phase constant to identify the cutoff frequency for each mode.

---

### **Step 10: Add Markers to Identify Cutoff Frequencies**
- **Action**: Right-click on the plot and select "Add Marker."

### **Step 11: Plot Attenuation Constant**
- **Action**: Similarly, plot the attenuation constant (real part of Gamma) for all modes.
- **Event**: Analyze the attenuation characteristics of the waveguide.
- **Function**: Understand signal loss in the waveguide.

---

### **Step 12: Plot Electric Field Distribution**
- **Action**: Select the waveguide cavity object (wg_cavity), right-click, and select Plot Fields > E > Mag_E.
- **Event**: Choose the solution and frequency sweep, then select Mag_E under Quantity.
- **Function**: Visualize the magnitude of the electric field distribution inside the waveguide.

---

### **Step 13: Animate Electric Field Distribution**
- **Action**: Right-click on the Mag_E plot and select "Animate."
- **Event**: Keep the default settings and click OK.
- **Function**: Observe the dynamic behavior of the electric field inside the waveguide.

### **Step 15: View Field Distribution for Different Modes**
- **Action**: Go to the Excitation category, right-click, and select "Edit Sources."
- **Event**: Change the magnitude of Mode 2 to 1 and Mode 1 to 0.
- **Function**: Update the field distribution to visualize different modes.

---

### **Step 16: Analyze Mode-Specific Field Patterns**
- **Action**: Repeat the process for other modes by adjusting their magnitudes and phases.
- **Event**: Observe the updated field distribution for each mode.
- **Function**: Study the behavior of different modes in the waveguide.
