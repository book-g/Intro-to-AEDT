### **Step-by-Step Guide: Designing a WR-15 Rectangular Waveguide in Ansys HFSS (Part 1)**  

This guide will walk you through creating a **WR-15 rectangular waveguide** using **Ansys HFSS (AEDT Student Version 2021)**.

---

### **Step 1: Open Ansys HFSS (AEDT Student Version)**
- Launch **Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT)**.
- In the **Projects tab**, select **Insert HFSS Design**.

---

### **Step 2: Set the Unit System**
- By default, HFSS uses **millimeters (mm)**.
- Change it to **mils** (1 mil = 0.001 inches):
  - Click on **Units** â†’ Select **Mils** â†’ Click **OK**.

---

### **Step 3: Create the WR-15 Waveguide Geometry**
- **Standard WR-15 dimensions (in mils)**:
  - **Width (W):** 148 mils  
  - **Height (H):** 74 mils  
  - **Length (L):** Appropriate length for simulation  

#### **Drawing the Waveguide Box**
- Navigate to the **Draw** tab.
- Click **Draw Box**.
- Define the **box vertices** in the **XY plane** and extend it in the **Z plane**.
- A new object named **Box1** is created.

---

### **Step 4: Edit the Waveguide Dimensions**
- **Modify Box1 Dimensions**:
  - Double-click on **CreateBox** in the **Modeler Tree**.
  - A pop-up window appears where you can enter:
    - **X-dimension:** 148 mils
    - **Y-dimension:** 74 mils
    - **Z-dimension:** (as per required length)
  - Click **OK**.

- **Alternative Method (Using Properties Panel)**:
  - In the **Properties Panel** (bottom left of UI), directly edit **Box1 dimensions**.

- Use **Ctrl+D** to **fit the view** in the modeler window.

---

### **Step 5: Rename and Assign Material**
- **Rename the object:**
  - Double-click on **Box1**.
  - Change the name to **wg_cavity**.

- **Assign material to the waveguide:**
  - Click on the **Material cell** next to **wg_cavity**.
  - Click **Edit**.
  - In the pop-up window, choose **Taconic** as the material.
  - Click **OK**.

- **Adjust Transparency**:
  - Set **Transparency = 0.8** (allows viewing of internal fields).

---

### **Step 6: Understanding HFSS Boundary Conditions**
- HFSS automatically **treats all exterior surfaces** as **Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC)**.
- **No need to create a separate metal housing** for the waveguide.

---

### **Step 7: Save the Project**
- Click **File > Save As**.
- Name your project (e.g., "WR15_Waveguide").
- Save it in your preferred directory.

---

### **Step 8: Next Steps**
- This completes the **waveguide geometry creation**.
- In the next part, we will **set up excitations, define frequency parameters, and run the simulation**.

(00:00) And welcome to this video introducing Ansys HFSS. An HFSS stands for high frequency simulation software and it is one of the simulation tools that are inside of the Ansys Electronics Desktop AEDT for short. HFSS provides an electromagnetic solution based on your model geometry. It allows you to see and visualize many different results not limited to but includes S-parameters electric and magnetic field plots and one of its primary examples are waveguides and waveguides have been around for almost a century and they
(00:53) come in many different shapes and sizes and construction functionally they're all inline to its fundamental use which is a means to transport or guide energy from one point to another point efficiently. It's a transmission line and the transmission line that cross section can be rectangular or circular or any shape for that matter and that's why we need an electromagnetic simulation tool and today waveguides and its components are an integral part of any application communications/millimeter 5G applications, power, medical
(01:36) any industry commercial, military waveguides are used everywhere and waveguides have suggested frequency range of operation based on their physical dimensions and the relationship between the waveguide dimensions and the lowest frequency is simple. If W is the larger of the rectangular cross-sectional area then the longest wavelength that can propagate is lambda equals 2W and the lowest frequency is the frequency over C/lambda or 2W.
(02:14) So, let's design a rectangular waveguide using HFSS in the Ansys Electronics Desktop Student version for a 5G millimeter waveband. The WR15 it's in the V band and we look at some of its characteristics and W is used in the naming convention of the rectangular waveguide WR rectangular waveguide followed by W in mills divided by 10 that's the standard naming dimension.
(02:46) Open up that student version insert an HFSS 3D design by checking on the projects tab and selecting insert HFSS design by default the HFSS is length unit is in millimeters and so we need to change it from millimeters to mills click on the units tab and let's select mills in the unit type and click OK. So, now let's go ahead and design a WR15 waveguide cavity as per the electronic industry alliance the EIA standards which covers the V band.
(03:25) the inside dimensions of the waveguide cavity in mills are 148X74. On the tab name draw select draw box command select the box vertices as shown first in the XY plane then in the Z plane and you'll notice that an object called Box1 is created under the solid type with vacuum material on the left hand side folder in the 3D modeler window and let's edit the dimensions of this box double click on the CreateBox command a pop-up window appears in the UI interface note there's always more than one way to do an action
(04:08) inside of HFSS so you can always directly edit the Box1 inside the property panel window and by default that is on the bottom left and you use these finite dimensions for the waveguide for the WR15 click on ok to accept the changes for the dimensions and also remember we can use the keyboard shortcut keys like ctrl+D to fit all the contents in the modeler window view.
(04:40) We could view the AEDT UI introduction for a list of the common shortcut keys. Let's modify the box attributes double click on that object Box1 open up the attributes dialog box and you can rename the box to wg_cavity sometimes if you appropriately name the object it's very helpful especially in more complex design that has many numerous objects you can change the material click on the cell next to the material attribute and select edit select definition pop-up window appears and that contains a list of all of the
(05:22) materials available in the selected library and by default electrical material properties are listed. AEDT includes coupled multiphysics so, you can also view thermal and or structural material properties as well. So, let's fill the waveguide with some material say Taconic and click ok and you can also select the color for the object and set its transparency set the transparency to 0.
(05:59) 8 this way you can see the fields. So far we've created the object that represents the waveguide interior and that is enough for the rectangular waveguide geometry creation the reason behind that is that HFSS treats everything in the exterior of the simulation domain to be a perfect electric conductor it's covered with a PEC material hence there's no need to create a metal housing for the waveguide.
(06:32) See you in the next video where we'll prepare the necessary steps for the electromagnetic simulation inside of the AEDT student version thank you for watching this video and find more information on HFSS or any of the Ansys simulation tools just go to ansys.com/courses today
