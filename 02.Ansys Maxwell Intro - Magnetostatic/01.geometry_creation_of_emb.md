Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the actions, events, and functions described in the transcript for creating the geometry of an Electromagnetic Brake (EMB) using Ansys Maxwell:

---

### **Step 1: Launch Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT)**
- **Action**: Launch the Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) Student version.
- **Event**: Open the Maxwell project.
- **Function**: Navigate to the Desktop tab > Maxwell > Select Maxwell 3D from the dropdown.

---

### **Step 2: Create and Rename Project**
- **Action**: A new Maxwell 3D design is added under the project folder.
- **Event**: Rename the project to "EMB".
- **Function**: Organize the project for clarity.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Modeler Options**
- **Action**: Go to Tools > Options > General Options.
- **Event**: Under 3D Modeler, ensure "Edit properties for new primitives" is checked.
- **Function**: Set drawing units to millimeters for consistency.

---

### **Step 4: Draw the Core**
- **Action**: Use the Draw tab to select "Draw Cylinder".
- **Event**: Left-click on the origin, expand in the XY plane, then expand in the Z plane.
- **Function**: Create a cylinder with a radius of 25 mm and height of 20 mm.

---

### **Step 5: Adjust Dimensions**
- **Action**: Open the Properties window for the cylinder.
- **Event**: Change the radius to 25 mm and height to 20 mm.
- **Function**: Use Ctrl+D to fit the model in the 3D view.

---

### **Step 6: Create Spacer and Coil**
- **Action**: Select "Draw Circle" and click on the top center of the core.
- **Event**: Draw two circles with radii of 20 mm and 15 mm.
- **Function**: Rename the circles as Circle1 and Circle2.

---

### **Step 7: Subtract Circles**
- **Action**: Select both circles (Circle1 and Circle2) using Ctrl.
- **Event**: Click "Subtract" on the Draw ribbon.
- **Function**: Ensure Circle1 is the blank part and Circle2 is the tool. Clone tool objects if needed.

---

### **Step 8: Thicken the Sheet**
- **Action**: Right-click on Circle1 > Edit > Surface > Thicken Sheet.
- **Event**: Input -15 mm to extend in the negative Z direction.
- **Function**: Create a 3D object from the 2D circle.

---

### **Step 9: Subtract from Core**
- **Action**: Select the core (Cylinder1) and Circle1 using Ctrl.
- **Event**: Click "Subtract" and ensure the core is the blank part.
- **Function**: Create a hollow space in the core.

---

### **Step 10: Assign Material Properties**
- **Action**: Double-click on Cylinder1 and rename it to "Core".
- **Event**: Assign material as Steel 1008, adjust color, and set transparency to 50%.
- **Function**: Define material properties for the core.

---

### **Step 11: Create Coil**
- **Action**: Double-click on Circle1 and rename it to "Coil".
- **Event**: Assign material as Copper, adjust color, and set transparency.
- **Function**: Define material properties for the coil.

---

### **Step 12: Create Center Hole for Shaft**
- **Action**: Select "Draw Cylinder" and create a cylinder at the origin.
- **Event**: Set radius to 4 mm and height to 20 mm.
- **Function**: Subtract this cylinder from the core to create a shaft hole.

---

### **Step 13: Create Brake Plate**
- **Action**: Press "F" for face selection mode and select the bottom surface of the core.
- **Event**: Right-click > Edit > Surface > Create Object from Face.
- **Function**: Thicken the surface to 4 mm to create the brake plate.

---

### **Step 14: Move Brake Plate**
- **Action**: Select the brake plate and use the "Move" tool.
- **Event**: Move along the Z-axis by 24 mm + gap (gap = 0.3 mm).
- **Function**: Define a parametric gap for analysis.

---

### **Step 15: Create Spacer Screw Holes**
- **Action**: Change view to top view and draw cylinders at the outer edge of the core.
- **Event**: Set radius to 1.5 mm and height to -15 mm.
- **Function**: Duplicate the cylinders around the Z-axis at 90-degree intervals (4 holes).

---

### **Step 16: Subtract Screw Holes**
- **Action**: Select the core, brake plate, and 4 cylinders using Ctrl.
- **Event**: Click "Subtract" and ensure the brake plate is the blank part.
- **Function**: Create holes for spacer screws.

---

### **Step 17: Save the Project**
- **Action**: Save the project using Ctrl+S.
- **Event**: Geometry creation is complete.
- **Function**: Prepare for the next steps (excitation, boundary conditions, and parametric analysis).

---

### **Summary of Key Functions**
1. **Geometry Creation**: Drawing cylinders, circles, and using Boolean operations (subtract).
2. **Material Assignment**: Assigning materials (Steel 1008 for core, Copper for coil).
3. **Parametric Setup**: Defining a gap for parametric analysis.
4. **Organization**: Renaming objects and saving the project.

This step-by-step process ensures the geometry for the EMB is created accurately and ready for further simulation setup.
