Transcript:
(00:00) And welcome back and in the previous videos, we have created a 3D electromagnetic brake geometry and we performed a parametric simulation to see the effect of the size of an air gap on the force that's generated by the electromagnetics on a movable brake plate and in this video let's see how we can take advantage of symmetry in that model geometry and create a 2D geometry out of the 3D model and we will perform the same parametric simulation and see how the results compare between the 2D and the 3D.
(00:51) So, let's get started! Go ahead open the EMB model from that last session in the AEDT student version. Rename the design as EMB_3D and let's make a copy of this model. Simply drag and drop the model design onto the project name. That's a quick copy and paste and then if you look at this model it is symmetric around the Z-axis.
(01:16) So, there are holes for the springs and screws but the total surface area is much larger than the area of the holes and so the effect of the holes on the overall results is negligible. Go ahead rotate the design to make sure that we don't include those screw holes in this 2D section. Do a ctrl+A and select all and click on rotate in that pop-up window.
(01:39) Select the Z axis and the angle equals 45 degrees and click ok. Right mouse click on the 3D design under the project manager window. Select create 2D design and in that pop-up window leave the coordinate system as global. For the section plane we can select either YZ or ZX. Let's go ahead and select YZ. For 2D geometry modes you have two options.
(02:05) If the model is axis symmetric about some axis then go ahead and select the XY plane and if the model's rotational axis symmetry example cylindrical symmetry around the Z-axis then select the axis as Z and the EMB model is symmetric around Z. Go ahead select the Z and click ok. Rename the newly created 2D model to EMB_2D and you'll see not only the 2D section is created but also the attributes and the design variables that are related to all the objects are also transferred into that 2D design but we still need to assign the excitations,
(02:49) the boundaries and set up the analysis and we can simplify this model even more by taking advantage of the 360 degree symmetry of the model. Select the region, delete it. Ctrl+A to select to all the objects that are left in the 3D modeler window right mouse click edit > boolean > separate bodies. Now go ahead and select everything that's on the negative X-axis and delete it and what we now have left is the 2D symmetry part of the EM brake and if we sweep this part by 360 degrees we'll get back that 3D model
(03:25) of the full 3D model EMB. Select the brake plate right mouse click assign parameter > force and then in that pop-up window keep the defaults click ok. Select the coil right mouse click assign excitation > current. In the pop up window again keep the name as current1 under the parameter values write amp*turns.
(03:48) Any choice of reference direction is okay click ok. Create the region select the rectangle under the draw tab and draw a rectangle as shown. In that pop-up window change the parameters as shown below and click ok. Keep that rectangle selected and change the transparency to 0.9 under the properties window change the selection mode to edge you can do this quickly by pressing the E key on the keyboard.
(04:16) Hold the ctrl key and select the three edges as shown release the ctrl key right mouse click assign boundary > balloon click ok. Another pop-up window, right mouse click on the analysis > add the solution setup and the pop-up window keep the defaults click ok. right mouse click on optimetrics now add a parametric in that pop-up window select add.
(04:40) Now we're going to add the parametric setup for that air gap as the same as we did in that 3D model simulation. Start at 0.2 millimeters stop at 1 millimeters in steps of 0.1 millimeters click add then okay. Under the options select save fields and mesh. Now, click ok. Go to the simulation tab and validate the design.
(05:04) No errors on the setup. Go ahead click close. Right mouse click on the parametric setup select analyze and after the simulation is completed right mouse click under the results create magnetostatic > report > rectangular plot On the pop-up window under the context go ahead and select parameter > force1 quantity > force_z function > mag for magnitude and then click on new report and close.
(05:34) Now let's compare the force data between the 2D and the 3D results. Go to results in the 3D design right mouse click on the force_mag copy the data now go to the 2D design. Go to that result select the plot right mouse click and paste it. Now you see both graphs both sets of data and they are in good agreement.
(05:58) There are minor differences but that can be attributed mainly to that initial mesh setting. So, remember in the 3D model we change it to a coarse mesh because in that 3D design we were using the student version and there are some mesh element limitations. So, now let's go ahead and plot the flux density plot and see how they compare and you can see that the saturation levels at the various locations on the model are also in good agreement.
(06:26) So what we have done just now is we have shown in this video is that if we take advantage of symmetry in the model geometry and this will help us reduce the number of mesh cells that replicates that model geometry that also means we reduce the required simulation time and the necessary computer resources and this is without affecting the overall results.
(06:53) So, this completes the four part series of magnetostatic simulation using AEDT student version. Thank you for watching this video. Find more information on Ansys Electronics Desktop AEDT for short or any of the Ansys simulation tools. Go to ansys.com/courses today.
